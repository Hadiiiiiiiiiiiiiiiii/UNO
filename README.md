# UNO
An UNO game I created as a fun little project!
To run this game, all you have to do is go to game.py, and run it!
You will have a list of ASCII cards representing your hand.
As this is classic uno, no wildcards are included.
The number of cards the computer has and ground card are printed in text.
To play, simply type the index of the desired card, if you dont know what to play you can look at the list indicating valid playable indexes guiding you on what you can play.
If you have no valid cards, a card is automatically drawn into your hand.
The computer plays based on strategy of not running out of any colors, meaning it prioritizes playing a color it has an abundance of.
